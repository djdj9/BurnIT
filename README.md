BURNIT is a deflationary token protocol built on Solana that automatically buys back and burns tokens using trading fees.

## 📚 Overview

BURNIT is created for the $BURNIT token where **0.5% of all trading fees** are automatically used to buy back and burn tokens, reducing supply and potentially increasing value for holders over time.

- **Auto-Burn Mechanism**: 0.5% of trading fees are allocated to buy and burn BURNIT tokens

🔄 BURNIT Flow

0.5% of fees are automatically allocated to the buyback fund
